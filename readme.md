# The irregularly updated extension of Kino’s Alt-Latin keyboard layout.  
#### Credit for the base goes to one Kino from the University of Chicago for making it, and Theo Beers for fixing it so that it actually works on Windows 10 (Kino made it in 2004, so understandably it doesn’t work anymore)

## A few things
+ I’m not pretending that I made any of these changes to make sense for anyone other than myself—to me, they might be the most logical thing in the world, while someone else looks on and thinks “What in the black river has he been sniffing?”. I’m only working with what I have here, which is an already rich keyboard layout, and an ISO keyboard with a number pad. And on that…
+ The changes I make to this layout assume that the keyboard in use has a number pad, and the extra key on the bottom left row, between z and left Shift; present on ISO keyboards, which are most commonly found in Europe. While the most important characters are already present and thus don’t need adding, I will not hesitate to use any of these keys as an added benefit.

With that out the way, let’s begin.

## Installation
This is the easiest part; 
1) Grab the `.zip` containing the latest iteration (or the desired one) from its respective folder—or if you so desire the entire repo, it’s all sausage to me
2) Extract if applicable and enter the folder it creates
3) Open `setup.exe`
4) Wait for the message telling you it’s been installed to pop up
5) Restart your computer
6) Go to Settings – Time & Language – [your preferred language] – Options, click `Add a keyboard`, and select `Alt-Latin 2019 - CE` if you installed the base version, or `Muncher‐Flavoured Alt‐Latin` if you installed a later one. In any case, the installed layout should show up at the top
7) Profit

If you use numerous other keyboard layouts already, you may want to consider uninstalling those, leaving only one behind for the language you want to use this layout on. Your mileage may vary, but I’ve had nothing but headaches installing this until I temporarily uninstalled the Russian language and layout.

## Changelog
Version 1.0 is the base, which consists of Beers’ version (available [here][^1]), with a few changes consolidated into this build:  
+ Added the glottal stop character `ʔ` to `AltGr + numpad decimal`
+ Added the hyphen `‐` to `AltGr + f` [^2]
+ Added left angle bracket `<` to `ISO` and right angle bracket `>` to `AltGr + ISO`
+ Added broken pipe character `¦` to `Shift + ISO` and broken l `ꝇ` to `Shift+AltGr + ISO`

[^2]: This doesn’t make all the sense in the world, but I also program and for that I need Hyphen‐Minus `-` (this is what most people mean when they refer to ‘hyphen’, the “hyphen” key outputs this); besides, it’s easy to type this way and the Hyphen‐Minus / underscore key was already filled completely.  
Outside all of that, I mostly make the changes I make based on what works for me; so if it seems weird, labyrinthine and convoluted to you, rest assured I was barely trying to inject any sense into it.
